# Colophon Cards

## Introduction

You are reading the planning and design repository for Colophon Cards (Kólófón).

This project aims to create a prototype for a bookmarking and reading-oriented note-taking app that pulls together many of the best practices in note-taking, hypertext, and reading theory.

The project leader is [Baldur Bjarnason](https://www.baldurbjarnason.com/). It is made possible by a grant from [The Icelandic Centre for Research's Technology Development Fund](https://en.rannis.is/funding/research/technology-development-fund/nr/545)

Even though the project itself isn't open-source, I aim to work as much in the spirit of OSS as I can. This is why I plan on doing the prototyping, design, and planning work for the project out in the open in this repository.

## The Pitch

In recent years we've seen a micro-revolution in Personal Knowledge and Information Management systems. On the low end, built-in apps such as Apple's Notes have added more sophisticated capabilities. On the high end, apps like Roam and Notion have been mining the years of research done by academia in hypertext, reading and writing. They have been leveraging academic concepts to add features that now challenge the mainstays in this category.

But, from this end user's perspective, there are a few problems that these systems haven't solved:

* The high-end systems have a very steep learning curve and a substantial cognitive overhead. As in: you spend too much time and energy thinking about your notes instead of using your notes.
* The low-end systems lack features for writing _about_ things: bookmarking, annotating, quoting, summarising, navigating, etc. They don't even have the most basic awareness of the structure of the objects (files, websites, or documents) that the notes are on.
* They all implement the same, highly specialised, mode of collaboration: real-time (or near-realtime) shared ownership and shared organisation.
* With very few exceptions (Ulysses app, for example), they pay very little attention to the purpose of note-taking, which isn't just to capture and organise ideas but to improve your work. Your notes should inform your projects, designs, and writing. To do so, you need to be able to easily turn your notes into documents that feed into your work.

My goal with Colophon Cards is to create a web-based note-taking app for bookmarking and reading websites, ebooks, and documents. It needs to find a balance between ease-of-use and advanced features. It should have a user-subjective sharing model built in from the start where data is shared while the organisation is specific to each. Finally, it needs to provide straightforward tools for turning notes into documents for sharing with others.
