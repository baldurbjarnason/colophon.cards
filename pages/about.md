# About Colophon Cards

Colophon Cards is a prototyping project made possible by a grant from [The Icelandic Centre for Research's Technology Development Fund](https://en.rannis.is/funding/research/technology-development-fund/nr/545).

I'm [Baldur Bjarnason](https://www.baldurbjarnason.com/), the project leader and this website is a chronicle of my journey to bring Colophon Cards to life, so that it can help solve your problems.

Even though the project itself isn't open-source, I aim to work as much in the spirit of OSS as I can. This is why I plan on doing the prototyping, design, and planning work for the project out in the open in [this repository](https://github.com/baldurbjarnason/colophon.cards).
